# Case Study: Women in Parliament

# Objectives

*Explore the geographical and time trends for the percentage of women in 
national parliaments.*

## Questions

The objective is to look at the geographical and time trends in the data. We will
answer the following questions.

+ What are the time trends for Portugal?
+ How does Portugal compare to other countries?
+ Which countries have the highest percentage of women in parliament by year?
+ How do continents compare?
+ What are the global trends over time?

## The World Bank Data 

The raw data for *"Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments"* 
includes the percentage of women in parliament (_"single or lower parliamentary chambers 
only"_) by country (region) and year. It can be downloaded from:

- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS 

As part of its "open data" mission the World Bank offers _"free and open access 
to global development data"_ kindly licensed under the "Creative Commons Attribution 
4.0 (CC-BY 4.0)".

## Source Data

The data originates from the "Inter-Parliamentary Union" (IPU) which
provides an *_"Archive of statistical data on the percentage of women in 
national parliaments"_* going back to 1997 on a monthly basis:

- http://archive.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif-arc.htm

The World Bank data is for “single or lower parliamentary chambers only”, while 
the IPU also presents data for “Upper Houses or Senates”. Moreover, the IPU provides 
the actual numbers used to calculate the percentages (which the World Bank does not).

## Data limitations

Take caution when interpreting these data, as parliamentary systems vary from country 
to country, and in some cases over time. Some of the issues to consider include:

- Who has, and who does not have, the right to become a Member of Parliament (MP)?
- How does someone become an MP? Through democratic elections? How is "democratic
election" defined? 
- What is the real power of MPs and their parliament? Can MPs make a difference?

## Data definitions & assumptions

### "Women"

The definition for “women” is not given, so we will assume that it refers to a 
binary classification for gender (sex).

### "Country (Region)"

The definition of countries and regions can change over time.  (e.g. formation of new
countries after conflicts, new member states joining a pre-existing collective). 
How are these changes reflected in the data? How do they affect the interpretation? 

# Data

Some of the information in this section is a repetition of what has been written but
it is dervived from the datasets provided by the World Bank. However this section is
automatically documented using the datasets provided by the World Bank. Any contradictions
with what has been previously written should be double checked.

```{r dataSource, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
wbCSVs <- list.files(here("data"), full.names = FALSE, pattern = "[.]csv$")
metaInd <- wbCSVs[grepl("indicator", wbCSVs, ignore.case = TRUE)]
indInfo <- fread(here("data", metaInd), 
                   header = TRUE)
indCode <- indInfo[, INDICATOR_CODE]
indName <- indInfo[, INDICATOR_NAME]
indNote <- indInfo[, SOURCE_NOTE]
indOrgn <- indInfo[, SOURCE_ORGANIZATION]
```

The data was downloaded from the World Bank's data website (https://data.worldbank.org) using 
indicator code '`r indCode`' ("`r indName`"):

> `r indNote`

## Data Source

The original data source is:

> `r indOrgn`

## Datasets Provided

The World Banks provides the following data files.
```{r datasetsWB, echo=TRUE}
wbFiles <- list.files(here("data"), full.names = FALSE)
indData <- wbFiles[grepl("^API", wbFiles)]
indMeta <- wbFiles[grepl("Indicator", wbFiles)]
ctyMeta <- wbFiles[grepl("Country", wbFiles)]
```

+ "**`r indData`**" contains the "`r indName`" data.
+ "**`r indMeta`**" contains the indicator meta data which is as described above. 
+ "**`r ctyMeta`**" contains the Country related meta data that can be useful to
understand the limitations of the data by country.


# Importing and "Tidy" the data

```{r readData, warning=FALSE}
wip <- fread(here("data", indData), 
            skip = 4, header = TRUE,
            check.names = TRUE)

cl <- as.data.table(codelist)[, .(continent, wb)]

wipcl <- merge(wip, cl, by.x = "Country.Code", by.y = "wb", all.x = TRUE)

setnames(wipcl, c("continent"), c("Continent"))


WP <- melt(wipcl,
           id.vars = c("Continent", "Country.Name", "Country.Code", "Indicator.Code"),
           measure = patterns("^X"),
           variable.name = "YearC",
           value.name = c("pctWiP"),
           na.rm = TRUE)

WP[, Year := as.numeric(gsub("^X", "", YearC))][
  , YearC:=NULL]


setcolorder(WP, c("Indicator.Code", "Continent", "Country.Name", "Country.Code", "Year", "pctWiP"))
setkeyv(WP, c("Indicator.Code", "Continent", "Country.Name", "Country.Code", "Year"))

WP
```

# Analysis

## Portugal - Trends and Comparisons

> What are the time trends for Portugal?

```{r PTplot}
WP[Country.Name %in% "Portugal"] %>% 
ggplot(aes(Year, pctWiP)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 50)) +
  ylab("% Women in Parliament")
```

> How does Portugal compare to other countries?

We selected six EU countries (due to space limitations) for comparison. It would 
be better to compare all EU and/or all European countries.
```{r euPctPlot}
# Countries to be compared
cCountries <- c("Portugal", "Sweden", "Spain", "Hungary", "Romania", 
                       "Finland", "Germany", "European Union")

CC <- WP[Country.Name %in% cCountries][
  , maxYear:=max(Year), by = .(Country.Name)][
    Year==maxYear, cLabel:=Country.Name][, maxYear:=NULL]

CC %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, pctWiP, colour=Country.Name, label = cLabel)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1990, 2024, 5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 50), breaks=seq(0, 50, by=10)) +
  expand_limits(x = 2024) +
  geom_label_repel(xlim = c(2018, 2024)) +
  ggtitle("Women in Parliament: EU Countries") +
  ylab("% Women in Parliament") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```




+ Which countries have the highest percentage of women in parliament by year?
+ How do continents compare?
+ What are the global trends over time?
